# bengould.org Brand Identity

## Positioning

**The through-line:** Good analysis leads to good outcomes. Ideas backed by follow-through.

Ben isn't a pure policy wonk (writes memos, goes home) or a pure political operative (runs campaigns, doesn't care about substance). He's the connection between rigorous analysis and real-world wins.

**Primary identity:** Policy strategist with teeth
**Secondary identity:** Political operator with substance

Lead with the analytical/technical → prove it with the political victories. The campaign wins aren't the product, they're the proof.

## Core Message

**Current frontrunner:** "Analysis that gets results"

Other candidates:
- "Rigorous analysis. Real-world accomplishments."
- "Policy that delivers"
- "When you want to get the job done"

Not: "Thought leader in civic innovation"
Not: "Helping communities thrive"
Not: "Strategic advisory services"
Not: "Helping cities work" / "Making cities better" (too mission-statement-y)

Something direct. Applied. Blue-collar energy even if the work is white-collar.

## Personality Attributes

| Attribute | Not This | This |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Intellectual | Academic, theoretical | Applied, practical |
| Political | Operative, hack | Substantive, principled |
| Professional | Corporate, consultant-speak | Direct, plainspoken |
| Serious | Stuffy, formal | Focused, committed |
| Technical | Inaccessible, jargon-heavy | Clear, grounded |

**Keywords:** Tenacious. Direct. Analytical. Practical. Committed. Results-oriented.

**Anti-keywords:** Visionary. Thought leader. Innovative. Passionate. (These are empty calories.)

## Audience Hierarchy

1. **Policy consulting prospects** (primary) — advocacy orgs, local gov staff needing technical analysis, ballot measure committees needing substance
2. **Civic tech / data projects** — organizations wanting strategic + technical leadership
3. **Political consulting** (word-of-mouth only) — campaigns, IEs. Not actively solicited, but included as proof of follow-through.

## Proof Points (ranked by weight)

### The Spectrum of "Getting It Done"

The site should show that outcomes happen across a spectrum — sometimes analysis alone moves the needle, sometimes you need the full campaign.

**Analysis alone moved the needle:**
- **Oakland Charter Reform Project** — Co-launched effort; being a credible threat (and being right) made it a priority for the new mayor to put together a working group. Still in progress.
- **BAC budget wins (2025)** — Identified problems in $2.2B budget that got fixed: mayor's staff salary adjustments, vacant director roles filled. [Mercury News coverage](https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/09/oakland-mayor-barbara-lee-no-pay-raise-budget/)
- **BAC reports** — Primary author of FY 25-27 budget review, CFP recommendations, parcel tax design analysis. Identified $62M+ in contracts lacking descriptions, compliance failures, questionable staffing decisions.

**Analysis + advocacy/negotiation:**
- **Measure FF drafting & stakeholder negotiations** — Before the campaign: wrote a measure designed to actually pass. Built coalition support. Not an advocate's wet dream, but a reasonable, balanced approach that earned endorsements from Mayor, City Council supermajority, Sierra Club, Building Trades, Berkeley Firefighters.
- **LandWatch Monterey County** (via EcoDataLab) — GHG inventories, EIR analysis, VMT modeling informing local policy debates

**Full campaign mode (when needed):**
- **Berkeley Measure FF campaign** — Led campaign to 60% victory, raised $140k+, defeated competing measure
- **Mark Humbert for Berkeley City Council** — Full-service consulting, won 63%
- **Empower Oakland IE for Charlene Wang** — Comms strategy, won 59% RCV

**Other credibility markers:**
- **Berkeley Environment & Climate Commission Chair** — Led city's climate advisory body
- **EcoDataLab President** — CBEIs for NYC, Toronto, King County, Portland Metro
- **Legislative Aide to Councilmember Lori Droste** — Direct local government experience

Note: Berkeley policy work (via BNHCA - http://bnhca.org/) was more organizing/direct communication — harder to point to as "my analysis → policy change" publicly.

## Visual Direction

### Distinction from EcoDataLab
- EcoDataLab = cool blue-gray, corporate-professional, "the firm"
- bengould.org = warmer foundation, personal, "the person"

### Proposed Direction: "Editorial Warmth"

**Color foundation:** Warm — not cream-soft, but parchment/warm gray. Grounded, approachable, human.

**Accent:** Deep amber/ochre OR muted slate-green (distinct from EcoDataLab's brighter green). Something that reads as "serious but not corporate."

**Typography personality:**
- Display: Something with presence. Slightly condensed or bold. Editorial energy — think newspaper mastheads, magazine covers. Serious but not stuffy.
- Body: Highly readable, slightly warm. Not geometric/technical.

**Layout energy:**
- Single page, but with weight
- Numbers deserve prominence (60%, $267M, 63%, etc.)
- Not thin/minimal — some density that rewards scrolling
- More "well-designed report" than "startup landing page"

**Depth strategy:** Borders-only or subtle shadows. Not heavy layered shadows. Let typography and spacing do the work.

### Typography Candidates (to explore)

Display options:
- **Newsreader** — editorial, warm serif with personality
- **Fraunces** — distinctive, slightly quirky serif
- **Instrument Serif** — clean, modern editorial
- **DM Serif Display** — bold, confident
- **Libre Baskerville** — classic editorial feel

Body options:
- **Source Serif Pro** — readable, warm
- **Lora** — humanist serif, good for body
- **Nunito Sans** — soft sans if we want serif/sans pairing
- **Work Sans** — friendly but professional

Want to avoid:
- Inter, Roboto, Arial (generic)
- Space Grotesk (overused in tech)
- Anything that reads "startup" or "SaaS dashboard"

## Content Structure (proposed)

1. **Hero** — Name, one-line positioning, maybe photo
2. **What I Do** — Services framed as outcomes, not deliverables
3. **Track Record** — The proof points, numbers prominent
4. **Current Work** — BAC, EcoDataLab link
5. **Background** — Credibility without being a resume
6. **Contact** — Direct, simple

## Open Questions

- [ ] Final tagline / positioning line
- [ ] Specific typeface pairing (need to see them)
- [ ] Whether to include photo in hero or elsewhere
- [ ] Exact accent color
- [ ] How much to say about each proof point (density vs. scanability)
