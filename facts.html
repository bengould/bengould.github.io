                        <br>
                        <p>Elected in a special mail-in-only election with record low turnout, District 4's incumbent councilmember has been a disappointment to our community. Neighbors, first responders, and policy experts agree that she's the wrong choice for our District. Here are a few of the instances where she's been on the wrong side of the issues, broken promises made on the campaign trail, and misled voters about her record:</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0em">On the Wrong Side of the Issues</h4>
                        <p style="font-weight: 700"><u>Voted against affordable housing</u></p>
                        <p>When a 52-unit project was proposed at <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/2902-adeline-st">2902 Adeline</a>, just blocks from the Ashby BART station, it would have included 10 affordable units - 4 very-low income, 4 low-income, and 2 moderate-income, while paying $136,000 in fees for affordable housing. However, when it came up for a vote before City Council, <a href="https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Clerk/City_Council/2017/04_Apr/Documents/04-25_Annotated.aspx">the incumbent abstained</a>, allowing the project to fail, and only supporting it <a href="https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Clerk/City_Council/2017/05_May/Documents/05-02_Worksession_Annotated.aspx">once it was reduced to 50 units, with only 9 affordable units</a>, providing only $68,000 for affordable housing.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p style="font-weight: 700"><u>Failed to support student affordable housing</u></p>
                        <p>The incumbent <a href="https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Clerk/City_Council/2018/05_May/Documents/05-01_Annotated.aspx">abstained</a> when it came to supporting a letter to the State Legislature supporting Sen. Skinner's bill, SB 1227, to create affordable student housing.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p style="font-weight: 700"><u>Advocated against streamlining affordable housing</u></p>
                        <p>When Councilmember Lori Droste propsoed streamlining affordable housing, the incumbent <a href="https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/berkeley-progressives-have-a-chance-to-prove-theyre-not-nimbys/Content?oid=11370389">advocated against the streamlining element</a>.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p style="font-weight: 700"><u>Appointed commissioners who regularly vote against housing</u></p>
                        <p>The incumbent's representantive on the Zoning Board <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.com/2018/07/30/berkeley-zoning-board-says-latest-2701-shattuck-proposal-is-still-excessive">regularly</a> <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.com/2018/07/09/co-housing-project-for-south-berkeley-voted-down-by-zoning-board">votes against</a> new proposed apartment buildings. In one example, she opposed a building proposed for an empty lot because it would create "too much open space"; in another, she opposed replacing a gas station with a building with merely 6 parking spots, a block from BART, because it would create "too much traffic".</p>
                        <br>
                        <p style="font-weight: 700"><u>Supported landmarking efforts to prevent new homes from being built near BART</u></p>
                        <p>The incumbent's appointed commissioner, Steve Finacom, led the charge to <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.com/2018/10/16/officials-overturn-landmark-designation-for-uc-berkeleys-campanile-way">landmark the view from Campanile Way</a> in an effort to prevent new housing from being built in Downtown - <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/04/06/view-from-uc-berkeley-campanile-cannot-be-landmarked">twice</a>. When the matter came up before city council, <a href="https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Clerk/City_Council/2018/09_Sep/Documents/09-20_Special_Annotated_Agenda_pdf.aspx">the incumbent voted in support of the landmarking</a>.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p style="font-weight: 700"><u>Proposed requiring trees on-site prior to renovating or expanding homes</u></p>
                        <p>The incumbent <a href="http://bit.ly/D4trees">wrote legislation</a> that would require property owners to maintain a certain number of trees per parcel, based upon parcel size and number of units.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p style="font-weight: 700"><u>Advocated for the creation of a homeless tent encampment with "minimum health and safety standards"</u></p>
                        <p>As a candidate in 2017, the incumbent pledged to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170129071813/www.electkateharrison.com/issues">establish a location for an authorized encampment</a>. In November 2017, the councilmember <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/11/01/sanctioned-homeless-camps-headed-berkeley">advocated for sanctioned encampments on the dais</a>, and in a recent questionnaire, the incumbent pledged to push for sanctioned encampments <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180831052250/http://berkeleycitizensaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Harrison-City-Council-2.pdf">with minimum health and safety standards</a>.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0em">Misled the Voters</h4>
                        <p style="font-weight: 700"><u>Inaccurately claimed credit for doubling affordable housing</u></p>
                        <p>In an early mailer, the incumbent claimed she was "Doubling the number of affordable units". Obviously, the number of affordable units in Berkeley has not doubled. Presumably, this was intended to refer to policies passed to increase the amount of affordable housing built on-site - but <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/04/06/berkeley-council-votes-to-increase-inclusionary-housing">those policies were actually passed back in April 2016</a>, almost a year before the incumbent took office. Other policies passed that adjusted the percentage did not come close to doubling the amount of affordable housing.</p>
