                                <p>I believe in the promise of Berkeley – a city of equal access to opportunity, of diversity of thought, of leadership in social justice and sustainability. However, in recent years, we’ve faced challenges which threaten our ability to live up to these values. The current City Council has not displayed the leadership needed to overcome them.<span id = "two"></span></p>
									<p>
									I’m running for Mayor to bring new ideas and new leadership to Council, so these issues get addressed as they come up, and to ensure we implement lasting solutions to truly address our long-term problems.

								<h3>Housing Affordability</h3>
									<p>Berkeley is in the midst of an unprecedented housing affordability crisis. In the last few years, prices have soared by double-digit percentages year after year, now reaching a median home price of $1 million – more than four times the national median price of existing homes.
									</p>
									<p>At its most basic level, our crisis is the result of from rapid job growth throughout the Bay Area, while the number of homes available has grown much more slowly. As a result, demand for housing is soaring, enabling landlords and property owners to sell only to the very wealthy, leaving everyone else to be priced out.
									</p>
									<p>This doesn’t align with our values. We believe in an inclusive Berkeley, which provides opportunities for new and old residents alike – not one that drives out its teachers and nurses. 
									</p>
									<p>To address this crisis, we need to build more housing at all income levels. New construction will enable people to move here without displacing existing residents, and affordable housing will ensure we can retain our socioeconomic diversity. Here’s how we can do more to facilitate the construction of both market-rate and affordable housing:</p>
									<h4 class="underline">New Construction</h4>
									<ul class="bulleted">
										<li>Allow homeowners to subdivide their homes into duplexes or triplexes so seniors can downsize without relocating, and families can stay together as children become adults, by amending R-1 zoning and the hillside overlay.</li>
										<li>Simplify the approval process for small, non-controversial projects by allowing staff approval with public comment, freeing up the Zoning Adjustments Board to focus exclusively on major and controversial projects.</li>
										<li>Create a pathway for existing buildings to undergo landmarking review and receive a finding of non-significance, valid for a fixed length of time, allowing for greater certainty in the development process while still preserving Berkeley’s architectural history.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4 class="underline">Affordable Housing</h4>
									<ul class="bulleted">
										<li>Raise new funds for affordable housing by implementing a progressive, tiered supplemental transfer tax on the value of properties that sell for more than triple and more than six times that of the national median price of existing homes (currently roughly $750k and $1.5M, respectively).</li>
										<li>Develop a fee for properties which are vacant or underutilized, thereby reducing supply and driving up the price of housing, and dedicate the revenue raised for affordable housing. </li>
										<span id = "three"></span>
										<li>Evaluate a parcel tax to dedicate a continual stream of revenue to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, to ensure steady funding for affordable housing even in the event of an economic downturn.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Parks & Public Infrastructure </h3>
									<p>In 1978, California voters passed Prop 13, which slashed funding for local government and restricted our ability to raise revenues. In spite of those funding restrictions, Berkeley has doubled its parkland over the last 40 years, and currently boasts 247 acres of open space.
									</p>
									<p>Unfortunately, the funding restrictions have very real consequences, and over time our parks, historic buildings, roads, and other infrastructure have deteriorated due to structural deficits. Some of our most treasured public resources, like the Marina pier, the Rose Garden trellis, or Willard Pool have been forced to close due to neglect and a lack of funding.
									</p>
									<p>Despite overwhelming support for our city’s parks, Council has failed to develop a concrete plan to address their long-term needs. It’s clear that our parks will ultimately either need additional funding to be maintained, or difficult cuts will need to be made – either intentionally or as a result of neglect. 
									</p>
									<p>As a young person, I want to ensure we maintain high-quality parks for both current and future generations. As Mayor, I would develop choices to fully fund, partially fund, or maintain current funding levels for parks and citywide infrastructure, with the difficult cuts made explicitly clear, and give voters the final say in what direction our city’s public resources should take. <span id = "four"></span>We’ve had great parks over the last forty years – we should have great parks over the next forty as well, but that will require changing our current trajectory.
									</p>

									<h3>Environmental Sustainability </h3>
									<p>Berkeley has a well-earned reputation for being at the forefront of environmental sustainability. Our city’s accomplishments range from being the first city to ban Styrofoam in restaurants, dating back to 1988; to our award-winning Climate Action Plan, which sets an ambitious goal of an 80% reduction in citywide greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, approved by 81% of voters in 2006. 
									</p>
									<p>However, as Chair of the Environmental Advisory Commission, I know our city still has many opportunities for improvement. Our Climate Action Plan fails to address the use of natural gas, which accounts for 36% of our citywide greenhouse gas emissions. Our Bicycle Plan, first developed in 1998, was never fully implemented; and new best practices have been developed over the past 20 years. And we have numerous opportunities to do better around transit, new construction, and climate mitigation.   
									</p>
									<div>As Mayor, I will support the following policies:</div>
										<ul class="bulleted">
											<li>Bring Berkeley’s bicycle infrastructure into the twenty-first century, with buffered and striped bike lanes, separated bike paths, and additional secure bike parking throughout the city.</li>
											<li>Require Net Zero Energy buildings to also be Net Zero Carbon in their day-to-day use. Ban the installation of appliances or systems that rely upon natural gas in new residential or commercial construction.</li>
											<li>Create a citywide green building standard, comparable to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) requirements.</li>  
											<li>Develop a Climate Adaptation Plan, building upon recommendations in the Climate Action Plan, to prepare Berkeley for a changing future; including strategies to plan for and mitigate sea level rise, handle increased stormwater runoff in El Niño years, manage extreme heat and increased fire risks, and develop drought resilience.</li>
											<span id="five"></span>
											<li>Expand bike sharing throughout the East Bay, and encourage the placement of bike-share stations in commercial areas and near major transit stops.</li>
											<li>Increase access to and frequency of public transit throughout Berkeley.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </section>
                            <section>
									<h3>Budget Priorities and Fiscal Responsibility</h3>
									<p>Effective management of Berkeley’s $430 million annual budget ($159M discretionary, $271M restricted funding) is critical for ensuring the City can provide adequate and effective services. Right now, however, the City lacks resources for many programs, ranging from unfunded pension liabilities to deferred infrastructure maintenance to capital improvements we can’t raise funds to pay for.
									</p>
                                    <p>(Want to learn more? Check out my <a href="/budget.html">budget visualization page</a> to see where taxpayer money goes.)</p>
									<p>Additionally, there are significant structural intergenerational inequities built into the current tax structure. Longtime established property owners (who by necessity tend to be older) pay significantly lower assessed taxes than newcomers, thanks to protections established by Prop 13, effectively resulting in young new homeowner subsidizing the use of city services for longtime residents. In some cases, one new homeowner might be paying as much as ten times more in taxes than what the previous occupant was paying.
									</p>
									<p>New residents who are forced to pay higher taxes should be able to see their increased tax revenue fund improvements to the city, but most of these additional taxes go into the general (discretionary) fund, where they’re primarily used to fund citywide necessities like police and fire – not investing in newer and better technologies and infrastructure, or greater fiscal stability for the City. As Mayor, I’ll support the following policies to help move our city towards a more sustainable budget and spend our resources better to invest in the future:
									</p>
									<ul class="bulleted">
										<li>Increase our minimum reserve fund level to 12%, from 8%, to ensure financial resilience in the face of an economic downturn or natural disaster. Develop and implement a plan to move towards the 16.7% reserve level recommended by the City Auditor.</li>
										<li>Identify and invest in opportunities to improve the City’s fiscal efficiency. Invest in modernized technology to streamline City processes, like payroll processing (which currently uses a system which is decades out of date). Reallocate resources to improve outcomes without increasing costs, like hiring technicians or social workers to respond to certain types of police calls, rather than highly trained (and expensive) police officers.</li>
										<li>Provide opportunities for voters to approve new dedicated parcel taxes to ensure certain levels of city services while freeing up General Fund revenues to take advantage of new opportunities (like funding for local community service agencies) or respond to new needs (like public financing of elections).</li>

									</ul>
