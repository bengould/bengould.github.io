                                <h3>Housing Affordability</h3>
                                <p>Berkeley is in the midst of an unprecedented housing crisis. For students, seniors, teachers, nurses, and too many others, finding housing they can afford is next to impossible.</p>
                                <p>Rapid job creation throughout the Bay Area is bringing new workers faster than we are building housing. The resulting housing shortage gives landlords the freedom to rent or sell only to the very highest bidders, while far too many are forced to risk their well-being on an affordable housing lottery with far too few below-market-rate homes available.</p>
                                <p>There’s no silver bullet to this problem - we have to build more housing for people at all levels of income, if we want to preserve our values of diversity, inclusiveness, and opportunity.</p>
                                <p>At the same time, we cannot sacrifice what makes Berkeley such an incredible  place to live. We must continue to protect our diverse range of neighborhoods and architectural heritage, and to ensure that new housing helps us achieve our affordable housing goals. Fortunately, our major commercial and transit corridors offer ample opportunities for new housing without disrupting Berkeley’s community fabric.</p>
                                <text>To address the housing crisis, Ben will:</text>
                                <ul class="bulleted">
                                    <li>Advocate for on-site affordable housing requirements, to ensure new construction provides socioeconomic diversity and fights segregation.</li>
                                    <li>Develop a density bonus program to enable new construction to achieve even higher levels of affordable housing.</li>
                                    <li>Reduce unnecessary obstacles to construction of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs).</li>
                                    <li>Explore public ownership models for affordable housing.</li>

                                    <li>Allow homeowners to subdivide their single-family homes into duplexes or triplexes, so seniors can downsize without relocating, and families can stay together as children become adults.</li>
                                    <li>Implement a Neighborhood Preference program, to ensure displaced residents can receive preference for affordable units.</li>
                                    <li>Enable low-income students with significant financial need to apply for inclusionary below-market-rate units.</li>

                                <h3>Parks & Public Infrastructure </h3>
                                <p>Berkeley’s parks and open space are the crowning gem of our city, but unfortunately many of these public resources have fallen into disrepair. Some of our most treasured spaces, like the Marina pier, the Rose Garden trellis, or Willard Pool, have been forced to close due to neglect and a lack of funding.
                                </p>
                                <p>At the same time, many elements of our vital public infrastructure are also failing. Berkeley’s streets recently received an “at risk” rating, indicating a prevalence of dangerous conditions. Dangling utility lines pose potential hazards in face of an earthquake. Uneven sidewalks present dangers to pedestrians and obstacles to access for those with mobility challenges. </p>
                                <span id = "four"></span>
                                <text>Fortunately, with the recent passing of Measure T1, we have an opportunity to tackle many of these challenges. On Council, Ben will:

                                <h3>Environmental Sustainability </h3>
                                <p>Berkeley has a well-earned reputation for being at the forefront of environmental sustainability. Our city’s accomplishments range from being the first city to ban Styrofoam in restaurants, to our award-winning Climate Action Plan, which sets an ambitious goal of an 80% reduction in citywide greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, approved by 81% of voters in 2006.
                                </p>
                                <p>As Chair of the Environmental Advisory Commission, Ben has been a strong advocate for environmental sustainability, addressing issues ranging from indoor air quality, to CO2 emissions from natural gas, to lead paint hazards in older buildings. On Council, he will continue to advocate for strong environmental and climate policies, to address our emissions and plan for a sustainable future.
                                </p>
                                <text>On Council, Ben will:</text>
                                <ul class="bulleted">
                                    <li>Advocate for new housing near transit, campus, and employment destinations, to help reduce vehicle use, congestion, and transportation emissions.</li>
                                    <li>Develop policies to substitute vehicle parking requirements for new buildings near transit for other community benefits, like affordable housing and funding for transit.</li>
                                    <li>Propose standards for on-site bicycle parking in new construction.</li>  
                                    <li>Bring Berkeley’s bicycle infrastructure into the twenty-first century, with buffered and striped bike lanes, separated bike paths, and additional secure bike parking throughout the city.</li>

                                    <li>Expand bike sharing throughout the East Bay, and encourage the placement of bike-share stations in commercial areas and near major transit stops.</li>
                                    <li>Work closely with BART and AC Transit to increase access to and frequency of public transit throughout Berkeley, including the 6, 51B, and 52. </li>
                                    <li>Reduce delays and obstacles to transit by adding bus-only lanes and transit priority signaling at major intersections.</li>
                                    <li>Reduce barriers to installing electric vehicle charging, and support addition of public electric vehicle charging stations throughout Berkeley.</li>
                                    <li>Develop requirements to ensure Net Zero Energy buildings meet their low-carbon promises, by phasing out the use of natural gas in new construction.</li>
                                    <li>Require new construction citywide to meet minimum levels of green building standards, comparable to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) requirements.</li>
                                    <li>Develop a Climate Adaptation Plan, building upon recommendations in the Climate Action Plan, to prepare Berkeley for a changing future; including strategies to plan for and mitigate sea level rise, handle increased stormwater runoff in El Niño years, manage extreme heat and increased fire risks, and develop drought resilience.</li>
                                    <span id = "five"></span>
                                    <li>Require new construction to install either solar panels, solar thermal, or green roofs, to reduce our emissions and increase access to sustainable energy and food.</li>

                                <h3>Budget Priorities and Fiscal Responsibility</h3>
                                <p>Effective management of Berkeley’s $430 million annual budget is critical for ensuring the City can provide adequate and effective services. Right now, however, the City lacks resources for many programs, such as addressing pension liabilities, building affordable housing, providing homeless services and housing, addressing deferred infrastructure needs, and ensuring fiscal stability in event of an economic downturn.
                                </p>
                                <p>(Want to learn more? Check out my <a href="/budget.html">budget visualization page</a> to see where taxpayer money goes.)</p>
                                <text>On Council, Ben will support the following policies to help move our city towards a more sustainable budget and spend our resources better to invest in the future:

                                    <li>Increase our minimum reserve fund level to 12%, from 8%, to ensure financial resilience in the face of an economic downturn or natural disaster. Develop and implement a plan to move towards the 16.7% reserve level recommended by the City Auditor.</li>
                                    <li>Identify and invest in opportunities to improve the City’s fiscal efficiency. Invest in modernized technology to streamline City processes, like payroll processing.</li>

                                    <li>Ensure resources are allocated efficiently. Work with the City Manager and staff to identify opportunities to improve service without increasing costs, e.g. hiring mental health staff to respond to mental health emergencies, in place of police.</li>
                                    <li>Explore opportunities for participatory budgeting, to give voters a direct say in how their taxes are allocated.</li>

Furthermore, as a UC student, Ben strongly believes in equal access to education and in the ideals of the public university system.
