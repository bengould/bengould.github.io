                            <p>I live at the center of Downtown Berkeley, and I love my neighborhood. Our vibrant Arts District continues to thrive, with the UC Theater recently reopening its doors; restaurants old and new contribute to a burgeoning culture of food and nightlife; and fledgling startups and businesses attract new workers and visitors to Downtown every day.</p>

                            <p>Downtown Berkeley is the heart of our city and continues to enjoy a spectacular renaissance. With the second busiest BART station in the East Bay and UC Berkeley mere steps away, Downtown Berkeley is increasingly a hub of art, commerce, and innovation. But we can’t take this amazing progress for granted; instead, we must continue the hard work of cultivating Downtown as a fully-realized neighborhood that is both exciting and welcoming for all.</p>

                            <p>Berkeley needs to engage in regional efforts that focus on housing first and address the root causes of homelessness.

                            <p>Berkeley’s breathtaking parks and open spaces are the pride of our city, but many of these public resources have unfortunately fallen into disrepair. Some of our most treasured spaces, like the Marina pier, the Rose Garden trellis, or Willard Pool, have been forced to close due to neglect and a lack of funding.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>At the same time, many elements of our vital public infrastructure are also failing. Berkeley’s streets recently received an “at risk” rating, indicating a prevalence of dangerous conditions. Dangling utility lines pose potential hazards in face of an earthquake. Uneven sidewalks present dangers to pedestrians and obstacles to access for those with mobility challenges.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Fortunately, with the recent passing of Measure T1, we have an opportunity to begin tackling many of these challenges. I want to build on that success by pursuing revenue and spending policies that ensure taxpayer money for reinvestment efforts are allocated in an effective, efficient, and equitable fashion. </p>

                            <p>Berkeley is in the midst of an unprecedented housing crisis. For students, seniors, teachers, nurses, and too many others, finding housing they can afford is next to impossible. Rapid job creation throughout the Bay Area is bringing new workers faster than we are creating homes. The resulting housing shortage enables landlords to rent or sell only to the very highest bidders, leaving everyone else struggling to find homes they can afford.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>There’s no silver bullet to this problem - we have to create more homes for people at all levels of income, to preserve our values of diversity, inclusiveness, and opportunity.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>At the same time, we cannot sacrifice what makes Berkeley such an incredible place to live. We must continue to protect our diverse range of neighborhoods and architectural heritage, and to ensure that new housing helps us achieve our affordable housing goals. Fortunately, our major commercial and transit corridors offer ample opportunities for new housing without disrupting Berkeley’s community fabric.</p>

                            <p>Berkeley has a well-earned reputation for being at the forefront of environmental sustainability. Our city’s accomplishments range from being the first to ban Styrofoam in restaurants, to our award-winning Climate Action Plan, which sets an ambitious goal of an 80% reduction in citywide greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 - a goal set by 81% of voters in 2006.

                            <p>As former Chair of the Environmental Advisory Commission, I have been a strong advocate for environmental sustainability, addressing issues ranging from indoor air quality, to CO2 emissions from natural gas, to lead paint hazards in older buildings. On Council, I'll continue to advocate for strong environmental and climate policies, to address our emissions and plan for a sustainable future.

                            <p>Effective management of Berkeley’s $430 million annual budget is critical for ensuring the City can provide adequate and effective services. Right now, however, the City lacks resources for many programs, such as addressing pension liabilities, creating affordable homes, providing homeless services and housing, addressing deferred infrastructure needs, and ensuring fiscal stability in event of an economic downturn.
